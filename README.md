## Welcome

This repository tracks the recent developments in the Synthetic Control Method (SCM) literature. It serves two purposes. First, it is an organized dump of my bookmarks from Twitter, GitHub, YouTube etc. The aim here is to keep track of the SCM updates. The second is to make sense of the different packages from an end-user’s perspective. This part has to do with how to apply these methods in our research work. On the theory side, several really useful notes already exist (see the Resources section).

I will keep adding content to this website. It might contain errors or the language might not be precise enough. This probably reflects my own poor understanding of what is going on. So please give feedback! The aim of this repository is to collectively build up notes and a code base that we can all use.

Some thoughts below from my own perspective (these are also subject to change over time):

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/CIMERSDSGE/SCM/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
